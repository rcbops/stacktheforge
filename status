Current status, next steps:
Complete Nova and Keystone Attribute conversion trello cards.
Use default attr (based on RCBOps support wiki default for havana/neutron) - add in SF equivalency.
Compare running configuration options from the services when using RCBOps/StackForge (dump of running services. map baseline)
Test a conversion from RCBOps install to StackForge cookbooks.
Look at steps required to make the above go!

In the interim:
Continue to run the attribute comparison script (in this repo) - which will compare attributes so that if we come back to this it won't be a lot of work to get back into it.
